# Framer Motion

This is my personal Framer Motion practice.

Follow the below steps if you want to play with the code base.

## System Requirements

- Node 18+
- A browser capable of running JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Operating System (Windows 10+, MacOS, Linux, etc.)
- A text editor capable of running JavaScript (Visual Studio Code, Vim, Nano, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.)
- RAM >= 4GB
- Disk space >= 1GB

## Installation

- On the top right corner of this page there is a button labelled `Fork`.

- Click on that button to create a copy of the repository to your own account.

- Open the terminal/CLI on your computer.

- Clone the repository by running the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/your-github-username-here/framer.git

- Remember to replace your username when cloning.

- Change directory to the repo folder:

        cd framer

5.  Open it in your Code Editor of choice. If you use VS Code, run the command:

        code .

## Running the application locally

- Open the integrated terminal in your code editor and install all project dependencies:

      npm install

- Launch the local server by running the below command to open the page in a browser:

      npm run dev
